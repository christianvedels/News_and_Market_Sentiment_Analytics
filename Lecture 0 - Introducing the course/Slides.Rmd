# Motivaiton for the course 

.pull-left[
- *It's all about information*
- Text is data. Data is text. 
- Applications: Business, Finance, Research, Software Development, Psychology, Linguistics, Business Intelligence, Policy Evaluation 
- In a world of LLMs you want to understand what is happening behind the fancy interface 
- The techniques live inside crazy sci-fi technologies, that you can learn. E.g. [literal mind reading](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)

> It turns out we can use this to understand markets - ***especially*** financial markets

# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

.pull-left[
*If you can buy cheaply something which is more valuable than its price, you can profit (arbitrage). But ...*
1. We all have access to the same information 
2. Everyone is interested in maximum profits
3. Everyone buys the undervalued assets 
4. Prices increases until the advantages is gone 


### Implications:
- If any 'hole' in the market occurs it is closed within milliseconds 
- We cannot beat the market because everyone has access to the same information

> - **However** if we can obtain *information* that is not shared (e.g. because we extract it better or faster using NLP), then we might still be able to beat the market. 

*This is what this course is about (and in practice a lot of applied NLP of broad utility)*
