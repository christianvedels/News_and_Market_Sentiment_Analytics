# Why Record Linking?

.pull-left[
- **Record Linking**:
  - Given two sets of records, we want to identify the same entities
- **Massive Data Streams**:
  - News articles, social media posts, and market reports.
- **Challenge**:
  - No standard representation for entities (e.g., “Johnson & Johnson” vs. “J&J”).
- **Key Goal**:
  - Link mentions of the same company, executive, or event across datasets.
- **Example**:
  - Match earnings reports to market news referring to “Johnson & Johnson” or “JNJ.”
- **Content**: 
  - Today's lecture draws a lot on recent advances in census linking - lessons apply readily elsewhere

# Record Linking in Practice

.pull-left[
- **String Similarity Measures**:
  - Handle variations in names and spelling differences.
  - Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler improve match accuracy.
- **Blocking Variables**:
  - Efficiently narrow down candidate matches by grouping (e.g., by dates, regions).
  - Blocking needs to be immutable facts.
- **Example**:
  - Link “J&J” in social media with “Johnson & Johnson” in news reports for sentiment analysis.

# String Distance Measures
.pull-left[
- **Common String Distance Metrics**:
  + **Levenshtein Distance**: Counts insertions, deletions, and substitutions.
  + **Jaro-Winkler**: Focuses on common prefixes.
  + **Hamming Distance**: Simple metric for strings of equal length.

]

.pull-right-narrow[
**Levenshtein Example**:  
kitten → sitting  
1. Sub 'k' → 's': `sitten`  
2. Sub 'e' → 'i': `sittin`  
3. Insert 'g': `sitting`
]

---
# Jaro-Winkler Distance
.pull-left[
- Weighted similarity measure:

  + Gives higher weight to common prefixes.
  + More robust for small variations.
Example: "jellyfish" vs. "smellyfish" 

```{python}
from nltk.metrics.distance import edit_distance, jaro_similarity

# Strings to compare
str1, str2 = "jellyfish", "smellyfish"
str3, str4 = "jellyfish", "jellyfic"

# Levenshtein distance
lev_dist1 = edit_distance(str1, str2)
lev_dist2 = edit_distance(str3, str4)

# Jaro-Winkler similarity
jw_sim1 = jaro_similarity(str1, str2)
jw_sim2 = jaro_similarity(str3, str4)
```

# Linking steps


**Source A**: Financial data; **Source B**: News data

--

.small123[
#### 1. Pick record
- We will pick the first record 'META' in Q1 2024 for **A**
]

--

.small123[
#### 2. Perform blocking
- We will only consider data from source **B**, which is in Q1 2024
- (Why not consider all of it?)
- We will now refer to the blocked version of **B** as **B'**
]

--

.small123[
#### 3. Run comparison
- Compare (distance/divergence) 'META' to all the the entity names in **B'**
- "META"="Meta"? "META"="Tesla"?, "META"="Nvidia", ...?
]

--

.small123[
#### 4. Make link
- Most probable link is candidate link
]

--
.small123[
#### 5. Repeat and make final decisions
- Repeat process for all data and make final decision
]

# The complications (1/3)

- Start with 'TSLA' in Q1 2024
- We can eliminate 'Spotify', 'Netflix', 'Oracle', 'Alphabet' by blocking (none in Q1)
- `LevDist('TSLA', x) for x in ['Meta', 'Tesla', 'Apple', 'Microsoft']`
  + [4, 4, 5, 9]
  + **"TSLA" is equally likely to be "Meta" or "Tesla"**
--

- Now we convert everything to lower case and repeat
- `LevDist('tsla', x) for x in ['meta', 'tesla', 'apple', 'microsoft']`
  + [3, 1, 4, 8] 
  + **"Tesla" is the most likely match to "TSLA"**

**Takeaway:** Forgetting to lowercase completely ruined the matching

---
# The complications (2/3)

### First step

- Start with 'GOOGL' in Q2 2024
- We can eliminate 'meta', 'tesla', 'apple', 'microsoft' by blocking (none in Q2)

- `LevDist('googl', x) for x in ['spotify', 'netflix', 'oracle', 'alphabet']`
  + [6, 6, 5, 8]: "GOOGLE" is likely to be "oracle"

- We eliminate 'oracle' from our future searches (since we know that 'googl'='Oracle')

---
# The complications (3/3)

### Second step

- Now we get to 'ORCL' in Q2 2024  
- We can eliminate 'meta', 'tesla', 'apple', 'microsoft' by blocking (none in Q2)
- We can eliminate 'Oracle' because it was already matched

- `LevDist('orcl', x) for x in ['spotify', 'netflix', 'alphabet']`
  + [6, 6, 8]: "ORCL" is likely to be "spotify" or "netflix"


--

**Result**: We matched "GOOGL" to "Oracle" and "ORCL" to "Spotify" or "Netflix".  
**Correct link**: "GOOGL" to "Alphabet" and "ORCL" to "Oracle"  
**Takeaway:** First best matches are not universally best matches


---
# Approaches

--
### Simplest solution
- Match it manually

--
### Better solution
- Produce dictionary of e.g. stock ticker names versus full names
- Run prediction
- Manually verify

--
### Scalable solution
- Run fully automatic matching
- No 'best' method.
- Experience pain and lost sleep

**Note: All approaches are error-prone and causes bias**

# The Computational Challenge of Linking

.pull-left[
### High Dimensionality
- As dataset sizes grow, the number of potential comparisons increases dramatically.
  - **Example**: Linking 10^6 records in **Dataset A** to 10^6 records in **Dataset B** requires up to 10^12 comparisons without blocking.
- Blocking reduces this, but the complexity grows with:
  + Number of blocking keys (e.g., dates, regions).
  + Number of candidates within blocks.
  + Immutable facts are not always immutable: Date of birth might change


]

.pull-right[

### Trade-offs in Blocking
- **Coarse Blocking**:
  - E.g. year instead of exact date
  - Risk of problematic matches
  - Lower probability of false negative matches 
  - High recall
- **Fine Blocking**:
  - E.g. exact date
  - Captures more true matches but misses many relevant matches
  - High precision
- Theoretical optimum (given preferences) exists, but hard to find

# Case: Census Linking

---
class: middle

# What to take from this case

- Seemingly strong blocking variables might not be so strong 
- There is noise in the matching variables, which is hard to overcome
- There are (potentially relatively surmountable) problems, which have not been solved

## Blocking Strategies

.pull-left[
- Use immutable facts (e.g., birth year and place).
- Race does not work very well in some cases
- It is hard to be over optimistic on how well people report basic facts about themselves
- Balance between precision and recall.
- Use age ranges instead of exact ages, or use some distance measure e.g. $1/(age_i - age_j)$

# It will never be perfect

.pull-left[
- There is a frontier of matching rate versus accuracy
- It will always exist 
- Choices needs to be made on what kind of problems you prefer

# Bias (1/2)

- Imagine you are interested in computing peoples lifetime income profiles across geography (important in market segmentation)
- Can you trust estimates based on linked samples? 
--

- Generally no
- Unique names are easier to match
- Unique names are more common for people with higher income


---
# Bias (2/2)

- Gets more complicated in regression analysis:

$$\log(Income_{i,2}) = \log(Income_{i,1})\beta_1 + \textbf{Z}\delta + \varepsilon_i$$
Would estimate intergenerational mobility if:
1. We know that the sample is not selected
2. There is only limited measurement error



---
class: middle

# Advice
1. **Avoid it**: Avoid having to do linking by providing unique ids to all your data. Tell team members, that they are potentially causing serious harm if they don't.
2. **Accept defeat**: It will never be perfect. Instead you face a trade-off between false positives and false negatives as well as seleciton bias 
3. **Efficient use of time**: Are you spending *3 weeks* developing something to save *3 days of manual work*? Then don't. 
4. **Human-computer-hybrid**: Often it is useful to produce a (bad) link with string distance manually improve it.

# Topic Modeling 
.pull-left[
- A common issue when dealing with text, is that we want to extract topics 
- *This is an unsupervised learning task*
  + E.g. clustering 
- We can derive valuable clusters from the classical approach 'Bag of words' 
  + k means
  + Latent Diriclet Allocation
- Great results from more modern approaches
  + K means - just in embedding space

# K Means
.pull-left[
- **Representation:**
  + **Bag of Words (BoW):** Each document represented by word frequencies.
- **Algorithm:**
  + K means leverages BoW for simple document similarity based on word occurrences.
- The simplest form of topic discovery. 
- Requires tinkering to get useful results

# K-Means implementation
.pull-left[
.small123[
### Steps
- **Step 0:** Clean data, remove stopwords, etc.
- **Step 1:** BoW representaiton
  + Each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies 
- **Step 2 (optional):** Consider reducing the dimensionality of the problem
  + I.e. limit to only useful words using PCA or other heuristics 
- **Step 3:** Run K means for k in 1:K
  + Use some evaluation metric to choose optimal k. 
  + Metrics: Sum of squared errors
  + Criterion: Elbow point

### Each K means run:
Init: Set k means $\{\mathbf{m}^{(k)}\}$ randomly

1. **Assignment**
  + Measure distances $\{Dist\} = Dist\left(\mathbf{m}^{(k)},\mathbf{x}^{(n)}\right)$ using e.g. Euclidean or Cosine distance
  + Assign all elements of $\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$ to an element of $\mathbf{m}^{(k)}$ for which $\{Dist\}$ is minimal
  
2. **Update**
  + Updates all $\mathbf{m}^{(k)}$ to be equal to the mean of its assigned elements of $\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$
  
- **Repeat 1 and 2 until convergence**

# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
.pull-left[
- We imagine that every document is generated in the BoW way
- But in two steps:
  1. Each document is a mixture of topics 
  2. Each topic is a mixture of words
- 1. and 2. are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution
- Topics are the latent part we are trying to identify

.small123[
### Steps
- **Step 0:** Clean data, remove stopwords, etc.
- **Step 1:** Prepare the document-term matrix (DTM)
  + Each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies or other features
- **Step 2:** Run LDA for a given number of topics
  + Use some evaluation metric to choose the optimal number of topics.
  + Criterion: Elbow point

### LDA estimation
**Hiearchical Bayesian model**
- $\theta_i\sim Dir(\alpha)$: Topic mixture distribution
- $\varphi_k\sim Dir(\beta)$: Word in topic k

To generate one document repeat:
1. Choose topic $z_{ij} \sim Multinomial(\theta_i)$ 
2. Choose word from topic $w_{ij}\sim Multinomial(\varphi_{z_{ij}})$

Can be estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo. E.g. Gibbs sampling

# Sentence-Level Transformer Embeddings
.pull-left[

### Approach
- Use transformer models designed for sentence embeddings (e.g., DistilBERT, RoBERTa).
- Sentence embeddings capture rich contextual information.
- Fine-tune or use pre-trained models for diverse downstream tasks.
- Create embeddings for each sentence in the dataset.

]

.pull-right[

### Steps
1. Embed the sentences
2. Reduce dimensions (PCA, t-SNE)
3. Run clustering algorithm (K-means)
