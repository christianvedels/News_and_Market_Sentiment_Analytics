# Week 5 Embeddings and zero shot classifiers

In these weeks coding challenge you are asked to use embeddings to build a zero-shot classifier

1. Find a sensible model to get word and sentence embeddings on HuggingFace
2. Would you expect the mean of the embeddings in a sentence to be approximately equal the the embedding of the entire sentence? Why? Please test with these sentences:
   + "He banked the plane sharply to avoid the ridge."
   + "He was a master banker because he built the best banks in the trench."
   + "He was a master banker - all accounts were kept in order."
   + "After hearing the sentence, he felt a mix of relief and regret, knowing that justice had been served."
   + "This is just a regular old sentence."
2. Build a zero shot classifier using cosine distance. And use it to to repeat [coding challenge 3](https://github.com/christianvedels/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/blob/main/Lecture%203%20-%20Classification%20pt%201/Coding_challenge_lecture3.md)
