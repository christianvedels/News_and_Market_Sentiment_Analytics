# Motivaiton for the course 

.pull-left[
- *It's all about information*
- Text is data. Data is text. 
- Applications: Business, Finance, Research, Software Development, Psychology, Linguistics, Business Intelligence, Policy Evaluation 
- In a world of LLMs you want to understand what is happening behind the fancy interface 
- The techniques live inside crazy sci-fi technologies, that you can learn. E.g. [literal mind reading](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)

# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

.pull-left[
*If you can buy cheaply something which is more valuable than its price, you can profit (arbitrage). But ...*
1. We all have access to the same information 
2. Everyone is interested in maximum profits
3. Everyone buys the undervalued assets 
4. Prices increases until the advantages is gone

### Implications:
- If any 'whole' in the market occurs it is closed within milliseconds 
- We cannot invest better than anyone else 
- Investing in what a chicken poops on is better than listening to an 'expert'

# Information Extraction in Financial Markets

.pull-left[
- The NLP promise is to be able to extract information 
- News about firms changes the expected returns on assets 
- [NVIDIA News](https://youtu.be/U0dHDr0WFmQ?si=EKAQgBiTekQhxl0u)
- If the expected returns on an asset increases or decreases there is an opportunity for arbitrage if prices have not changed
- NLP tools potentially allow us to be ahead 
- EMH dissallows open source implementations: You need to improve on the methods you get here
- **Timing is key**

# RAGs
- The modern approach to sentiment analysis
- Potent context awareness
- 'simple' networks of LLMs


---
class: middle

# RAG basics
- **Query**: Question you want answered. E.g. "Is the market bullish or bearish?"
- **Augmentation**: We want to augment this query with relevant information
- **Retrieval**: We retrieve relevant documents for the query
- **Generation**: We use this information to generate an answer. E.g. "bull"
- **R  A  G**

---
class: middle

# RAG applications
- Sentiment analysis
- Systematic document review
- Legal discovery / case review
- LLM magic. E.g. ChatGPT o1

---
class: middle
# Retrieval
- **Library:** Need to define and source a library. E.g. all press releases, etc.
- For any given query, we need to find a relevant match document in the library
- Approaches: Lessons from [Record Linking](https://raw.githack.com/christianvedels/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/refs/heads/main/Lecture%206%20-%20Record%20linking/Slides.html) + Searching embedding space

---
class: middle
# Retrieval
- **Query**: "How is NVIDIA doing?"
- **Library**: Press releases. Among which "NVIDIA releases devastating news"
- **Embedding approach**:
  + Embed the entire library
  + Embed the query
  + Find minimum cosine distance
- **Other approaches**:
  + Run entity recognition from e.g. spaCy
- **Trick**: Embed everything in the library beforehand and store it in a vector library

---
class: middle
# Augementation
- You simply prompt the LLM with the added documents as context.
- You can consider prompt tuning as in [arxiv.org/abs/2310.04027](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04027)

# Generation
- It is hard to get LLMs to behave:
  + *"Please for the love of everything you hold dear, just say 'yes' or 'no'. Otherwise I will forever hold you in contempt and fire you in shame. If you write ONLY 'yes' or 'no', you are my favorite employee and I will give you a huge bonus"*

# A very simple RAG
### ['SDU News RAG'](https://github.com/christianvedels/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/tree/main/Lecture%207%20-%20RAGs/Code)

#### Basic structure:
- Query: Questions about the market
- Library: News headlines
- Retrieval: Base on BERT embeddings
- Generation: 
  + Expert (analysis) $\rightarrow$ Censor $\rightarrow$ Expert (conclusion) $\rightarrow$ Zero-shot mapping to 'bear', 'bull', 'neural'

# Exam workshop

.pull-left[
- Will be held online on Monday 10:00-12:00
- Zoom link will be available on itslearning

### Format of the workshop
- 5-10 min. presentation on what you are working on
- Room for asking questions from your peers
- **This will not impact your grade in any way**
- My feedback will be limited but I will try to facilitate useful peer feedback.

### What you have to do
1. Have a look at the exam
2. Decide on a project you want to work on
3. Send me an email before Friday [christian-vs@sam.sdu.dk]
    + "Hi Christian, I will be working on [x]. I would like to give a 5-10 min. presentation on what I have been working on, on Monday".

- If noone is interested, we will of course just cancel.
    + No shame if it is not useful to you. Then I believe, that you know how to spend your exam time most wisely.
