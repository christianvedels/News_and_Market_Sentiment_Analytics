# 'SDU-News-RAG'

This is a a simple RAG module build as the final step of the News and Market Sentiment Analytics course at the University of Soutuern Denmark. Fittingly called 'SDU-News-RAG'. Please see the [full repository](https://github.com/christianvedels/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics) for more details about the course.


### Structure
- This is a very simple RAG based on a quantized LLM
- This is not intended to be a high performance model but simply a starting point for future improvements
