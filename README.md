# News and Market Sentiment Analytics
This is the GitHub page of [DS821: News and Market Sentiment Analytics](https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=fagbesk&id=156413&lang=en) offered in the Data Science masters of the University of Southern Denmark. Here you can find slides and other content for the course. If you are a student of this course, please also check the itslearning page of the course.  

**Please note:** *The course is being developed throughout the semester. Please check back for updates.*
## Course book
The course is loosely based on:
Patel, A. A., & Arasanipalai, A. U. (2021). _Applied natural language processing in the enterprise_. O'Reilly Media. https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-natural-language/9781492062561/

However, NLP is fast-moving these years. So although we will draw many examples from the textbook, we will also cover a few other things. 

## Lecture structure
Our lectures will generally follow this structure, which is roughly equally divided:
**Part 1:** Theoretical introduction  
**Part 2:** Practical examples  
**Part 3:** Coding challenge (follow-up from last time + challenge based on today's lecture)

**Reading for lecture 1:**
For the first lecture you have three tasks to do beforehand:

1. Please read Chapter 1 of Patel & Arasanipalai (2021), which is freely available here: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-natural-language/9781492062561/ch01.html

2. Is ChatGPT high-tech plagiarism? https://youtu.be/SJi4VE-0MoA?si=sqFxbEGQ27drkvFA  

3. This course teaches NLP techniques applied to financial analysis. We can put more or less weight on the application. Please think about the type of skills you want to learn from this course. Then we will adapt the lectures accordingly.
