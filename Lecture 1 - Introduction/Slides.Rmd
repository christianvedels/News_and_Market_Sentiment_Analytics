# Motivaiton for the course 

.pull-left[
- *It's all about information*
- Text is data. Data is text. 
- Applications: Business, Finance, Research, Software Development, Psychology, Linguistics, Business Intelligence, Policy Evaluation 
- In a world of LLMs you want to understand what is happening behind the fancy interface 
- The techniques live inside crazy sci-fi technologies, that you can learn. E.g. [literal mind reading](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9)
]

# Preperation
.pull-left[
- Read other literature assigned. 
- Read assigned PA2021 chapter. 
- Make sure you understand what is happening. 
- Please go off tangents. Tangents are the best - if not for this specific course.

**Coding challenge:**
- Will be challenging 
- Mistakes are great
- Make sure that you understand and can run the solution

# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

.pull-left[
*If you can buy cheaply something which is more valuable than its price, you can profit (arbitrage). But ...*
1. We all have access to the same information 
2. Everyone is interested in maximum profits
3. Everyone buys the undervalued assets 
4. Prices increases until the advantages is gone 

]
.pull-right[
![Efficient Market](Figures/stonks.jpeg)


### Implications:
- If any 'whole' in the market occurs it is closed within milliseconds 
- We cannot invest better than anyone else 
- Investing in what a chicken poops on is better than listening to an 'expert'

# Information Extraction in Financial Markets

.pull-left[
- The NLP promise is to be able to extract information 
- News about firms changes the expected returns on assets 
- [NVIDIA News](https://youtu.be/U0dHDr0WFmQ?si=EKAQgBiTekQhxl0u)
- If the expected returns on an asset increases or decreases there is an opportunity for arbitrage if prices have not changed
- NLP tools potentially allow us to be ahead 
- EMH dissallows open source implementations: You need to improve on the methods you get here
- **Timing is key**

# The promise of AI
.pull-left[
- The idea of the mechanic 'nightingale' ([HC] Andersen, 1844)
  + **Idea:** The mechanic version can never be as good because it is mechanic 
  + Reaches far back e.g. Descartes (1637) writes about automata in 'Discourse and Methods' 
- Can machines think? The idea of the Turing test (1950/60s)
  + If machines can think, they will respond convincingly in conversation

# Early rule-based systems
.pull-left[
- We can model behaviour by *if then* statements 
- ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966):
  + The earliest convincing chatbot
  + Looks for keywords and otherwise writes something generic or repeats something from earlier
- 1980's was the peak of rule based systems 
  + Based on linguistic theory
  + Grammar 
  + Morphology
  + Semantics

# The philosophical/linguistic problem
.pull-left[
- Can we distinguish reasoning from immitation? 
  + Chinese room problem (Seale, 1980) 
- What is the nature of language? 
  + Innateness vs. Empiricism (Chomsky vs. Vienna circle*)
  + Innateness $\rightarrow$ rule-based NLP 
  + Empiricism $\rightarrow$ 'empirical' (learning) methods 
- ChatGPT is a big score for the Empiricist hypothesis

# 90s computer power - 60s maths
.pull-left[
- **Empiricist problem**: Statistics alone can only predict - not understand structure. Mathematical limitation (Pearl, 2019)
- But we can phrase language problems as predictions problems 
- Black box circumvents innateness 
- We just need to estimate: $$P(word|\{text\},\theta)$$
- E.g. "He is a [word]"
- Choose $\theta$ to minimize predicition errors
- Could be based on e.g. a [universal function approximator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) like a neural network

# History of Neural Networks for NLP 
.pull-left-wide[
- **'Perceptron'** neural network (Rosenblatt, .orange[1958])
- **Long-Short-term memory** remembers and forgets previous words and letters (Hochreiter, Schmidhuber, .orange[1997]) 
- A rule-based trick: **Word embeddings:** Queens, Kings, men, women (Firth, .orange[1957] - But applied from .orange[2000/2010s]; Roweis & Saul, .orange[2000])
- **Tranformers**: 'Attention Is All You Need' (Vaswani, .orange[2017])
- **Masked models**: E.g. BERT (Devlin et al, .orange[2019])
  + "He is a [MASK] dog." $\rightarrow$  "He is a [smelly] dog."
- **GPT**: Radford & Narasimhan (.orange[2018]): What if we make models really large? E.g. 175 billion parameters and train it on 499 Billion tokens (GPT-3)
- **What is a good answer?**: ChatGPT etc. (.orange[2022]) trains a sepperate neural network to tell good from bad answers - reinforcement learning.
- **Hugginface**: Sharing of various transformer models.

# Setup
.pull-left[
- A lot of nltk 
- Also spaCy and transformers 
- Install guide for [spacy.io/usage](https://spacy.io/usage)

#### Conda environment

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
conda create --name sentimentF24
conda activate sentimentF24

conda install spyder
```

]

.pull-right[

# How to deal with paths

.pull-left-narrow[
- We want to write code which runs out of the box on any system
- We don't want to edit long paths. We want it to work.

.pull-right-wide[
.small123[
.red[**Bad:**] 
```{python eval=FALSE}
pd.read_csv('C:/Users/Christian/Dropbox/Teaching/F23_News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/2023/News_and_Market_Sentiment_Analytics/Lecture_2_-_Lexical_resources/Data/Novo_Nordisk_News.csv')

```{python eval=FALSE}
pd.read_csv('Data/Novo_Nordisk_News.csv')

### Solution?

--

- Make everything relative to where your code is by including this in the beginning of all scripts*:
.small123[
```{python eval=FALSE}
import os
script_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
os.chdir(script_directory)
``` 


]

.footnote[
\* Please share a more elegant solution if you have one
]

---
# Before next time
.pull-left[
- Read [chapter 2 and 3](https://www.nltk.org/book/)


- Run code from the chapters
  + Does it work?
  + How does it work?
