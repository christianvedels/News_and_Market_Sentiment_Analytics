78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
law;

78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made
the waters to stand as an heap. 78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
with a light of fire. 78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out
of the great depths. 78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
run down like rivers. 78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
in the wilderness. 78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
lust. 78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
in the wilderness? 78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for
his people? 78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation:

78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
doors of heaven,

78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
of the corn of heaven. 78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. 78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
he brought in the south wind. 78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea:

78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
habitations. 78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
own desire;

78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
was yet in their mouths,

78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
and smote down the chosen men of Israel. 78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
wondrous works. 78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
in trouble. 78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
enquired early after God. 78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
their redeemer. 78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
lied unto him with their tongues. 78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
stedfast in his covenant. 78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did
not stir up all his wrath. 78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
away, and cometh not again. 78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
in the desert! 78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
of Israel. 78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
from the enemy. 78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
field of Zoan. 78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
they could not drink. 78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
and frogs, which destroyed them. 78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
labour unto the locust. 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
with frost. 78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
hot thunderbolts. 78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. 78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,
but gave their life over to the pestilence;

78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock. 78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies. 78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tents. 78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
his testimonies:

78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they
were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved
him to jealousy with their graven images. 78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:

78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
placed among men;

78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
the enemy's hand. 78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with
his inheritance. 78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
given to marriage. 78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
lamentation. 78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
that shouteth by reason of wine. 78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
perpetual reproach. 78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim:

78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
which he hath established for ever. 78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
sheepfolds:

78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. 79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of
the earth. 79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
there was none to bury them. 79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us. 79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy
burn like fire? 79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name. 79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place. 79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. 79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of
thy servants which is shed. 79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to
die;

79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord. 79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. 80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth. 80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
and come and save us. 80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall
be saved. 80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy people? 80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears
to drink in great measure. 80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
laugh among themselves. 80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and
we shall be saved. 80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
heathen, and planted it. 80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep
root, and it filled the land. 80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedars. 80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
river. 80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
which pass by the way do pluck her? 80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
the field doth devour it. 80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,
and behold, and visit this vine;

80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance. 80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of
man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
upon thy name. 80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and
we shall be saved. 81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
God of Jacob. 81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
with the psaltery. 81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
our solemn feast day. 81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. 81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood
not. 81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered
from the pots. 81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee
in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of
Meribah. Selah. 81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
thou wilt hearken unto me;

81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship
any strange god. 81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
none of me. 81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
in their own counsels. 81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
in my ways! 81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
against their adversaries. 81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
him: but their time should have endured for ever. 81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. 82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among
the gods. 82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
wicked? Selah. 82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and
needy. 82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
wicked. 82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most
High. 82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
nations. 83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
still, O God. 83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head. 83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted
against thy hidden ones. 83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
confederate against thee:

83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
Hagarenes;

83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
inhabitants of Tyre;

83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of
Lot. Selah. 83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
at the brook of Kison:

83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
possession. 83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
wind. 83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
mountains on fire;

83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
thy storm. 83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
LORD. 83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
put to shame, and perish:

83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
the most high over all the earth. 84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of
hosts, my King, and my God. 84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
praising thee. Selah. 84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are
the ways of them. 84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain
also filleth the pools. 84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
appeareth before God. 84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
anointed. 84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather
be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness. 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly. 84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. 85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought
back the captivity of Jacob. 85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
all their sin. Selah. 85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from
the fierceness of thine anger. 85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
to cease. 85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
anger to all generations? 85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
thee? 85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace
unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to
folly. 85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may
dwell in our land. 85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed each other. 85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
look down from heaven. 85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
yield her increase. 85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
of his steps. 86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy. 86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant
that trusteth in thee. 86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. 86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my soul. 86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
supplications. 86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
answer me. 86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are
there any works like unto thy works. 86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
alone. 86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
heart to fear thy name. 86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will
glorify thy name for evermore. 86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
soul from the lowest hell. 86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before
them. 86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me. 87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains. 87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob. 87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her:
and the highest himself shall establish her. 87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
man was born there. Selah. 87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there:
all my springs are in thee. 88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
thee:

88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
the grave. 88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man
that hath no strength:

88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. 88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. 88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all
thy waves. Selah. 88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made
me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. 88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
praise thee? Selah. 88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
faithfulness in destruction? 88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in
the land of forgetfulness? 88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
prayer prevent thee. 88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
from me? 88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer
thy terrors I am distracted. 88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. 88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
about together. 88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
acquaintance into darkness. 89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. 89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
servant,

89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
all generations. Selah. 89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. 89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? 89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
be had in reverence of all them that are about him. 89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to
thy faithfulness round about thee? 89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,
thou stillest them. 89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. 89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world
and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. 89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon
shall rejoice in thy name. 89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
right hand. 89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and
truth shall go before thy face. 89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
righteousness shall they be exalted. 89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our
horn shall be exalted. 89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
king. 89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have
laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of
the people. 89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed
him:

89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
strengthen him. 89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
afflict him. 89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
that hate him. 89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
name shall his horn be exalted. 89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
rivers. 89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
of my salvation. 89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the
earth. 89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
stand fast with him. 89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
the days of heaven. 89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
iniquity with stripes. 89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips. 89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. 89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before
me. 89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
witness in heaven. Selah. 89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
thine anointed. 89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
strong holds to ruin. 89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
neighbours. 89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice. 89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
him to stand in the battle. 89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
the ground. 89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
with shame. Selah. 89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
burn like fire? 89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men
in vain? 89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. 89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest
unto David in thy truth? 89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. 89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. 90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. 90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
thou art God. 90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children
of men. 90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
past, and as a watch in the night. 90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in
the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it
is cut down, and withereth. 90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
troubled. 90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance. 90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years
as a tale that is told. 90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength
labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
fear, so is thy wrath. 90:12 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom. 90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
servants. 90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
glad all our days. 90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
children. 90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands
establish thou it. 91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty. 91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;
in him will I trust. 91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
from the noisome pestilence. 91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. 91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
arrow that flieth by day;

91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday. 91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked. 91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
most High, thy habitation;

91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling. 91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
all thy ways. 91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone. 91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him
in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. 91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. 92:1 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
faithfulness every night,

92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
the harp with a solemn sound. 92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
triumph in the works of thy hands. 92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. 92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. 92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of
iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:

92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. 92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
shall be anointed with fresh oil. 92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. 92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
like a cedar in Lebanon. 92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in
the courts of our God. 92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat
and flourishing;

92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no
unrighteousness in him. 93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world
also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea,
than the mighty waves of the sea. 93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O
LORD, for ever. 94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance
belongeth, shew thyself. 94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the
proud. 94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
triumph? 94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
workers of iniquity boast themselves? 94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
heritage. 94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
Jacob regard it. 94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will
ye be wise? 94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
eye, shall he not see? 94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? 94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
him out of thy law;

94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until
the pit be digged for the wicked. 94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
forsake his inheritance. 94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
upright in heart shall follow it. 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand
up for me against the workers of iniquity? 94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
silence. 94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
my soul. 94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
frameth mischief by a law? 94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. 94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them
off. 95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to
the rock of our salvation. 95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
joyful noise unto him with psalms. 95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the
hills is his also. 95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
land. 95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD
our maker. 95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the
sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day
of temptation in the wilderness:

95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my
ways:

95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
rest. 96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
earth. 96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from
day to day. 96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
people. 96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
feared above all gods. 96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the
heavens. 96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his
sanctuary. 96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
LORD glory and strength. 96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
offering, and come into his courts. 96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
all the earth. 96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the
people righteously. 96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
roar, and the fulness thereof. 96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all
the trees of the wood rejoice

96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people
with his truth. 97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
isles be glad thereof. 97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
judgment are the habitation of his throne. 97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
trembled. 97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his
glory. 97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
because of thy judgments, O LORD. 97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
far above all gods. 97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his
saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
heart. 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness. 98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he
openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of
a psalm. 98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
LORD, the King. 98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
that dwell therein. 98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together

98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity. 99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the
cherubims; let the earth be moved. 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he
is holy. 99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
LORD our God is holy. 100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
singing. 100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations. 101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
sing. 101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of
them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
person. 101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him
that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that
telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut
off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. 102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. 102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as
an hearth. 102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
to eat my bread. 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
skin. 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
desert. 102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
against me are sworn against me. 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
weeping. 102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
lifted me up, and cast me down. 102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
like grass. 102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
unto all generations. 102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
dust thereof. 102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
kings of the earth thy glory. 102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
glory. 102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
their prayer. 102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
appointed to death;

102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
Jerusalem;

102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
serve the LORD. 102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy
years are throughout all generations. 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands. 102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and
they shall be changed:

102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
shall be established before thee. 103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his
holy name. 103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases;

103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies;

103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is
renewed like the eagle's. 103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
oppressed. 103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
Israel. 103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
in mercy. 103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
ever. 103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities. 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
mercy toward them that fear him. 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us. 103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
that fear him. 103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so
he flourisheth. 103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
thereof shall know it no more. 103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
children;

103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
commandments to do them. 103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
kingdom ruleth over all. 103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
do his pleasure. 103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
bless the LORD, O my soul. 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
removed for ever. 104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
stood above the mountains. 104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
away. 104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
the place which thou hast founded for them. 104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
turn not again to cover the earth. 104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
hills. 104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
quench their thirst. 104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
which sing among the branches. 104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied
with the fruit of thy works. 104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. 104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
which he hath planted;

104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
trees are her house. 104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
for the conies. 104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
down. 104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth. 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
God. 104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
down in their dens. 104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
evening. 104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts. 104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
made to play therein. 104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat
in due season. 104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
they are filled with good. 104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their
breath, they die, and return to their dust. 104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
renewest the face of the earth. 104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
rejoice in his works. 104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
hills, and they smoke. 104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise
to my God while I have my being. 104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
LORD. 104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. 105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his
deeds among the people. 105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
works. 105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the LORD. 105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
and the judgments of his mouth;

105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
chosen. 105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations. 105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
an everlasting covenant:

105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
your inheritance:

105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
strangers in it. 105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
another people;

105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
their sakes;

105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
whole staff of bread. 105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
servant:

105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
him. 105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
let him go free. 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
wisdom. 105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
Ham. 105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
than their enemies. 105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
his servants. 105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
Ham. 105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
against his word. 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
their kings. 105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
their coasts. 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
trees of their coasts. 105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
without number,

105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
fruit of their ground. 105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
their strength. 105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
not one feeble person among their tribes. 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
upon them. 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
night. 105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
with the bread of heaven. 105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
dry places like a river. 105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
gladness:

105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
labour of the people;

105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise
ye the LORD. 106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
for his mercy endureth for ever. 106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
all his praise? 106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
righteousness at all times. 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;

106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
have done wickedly. 106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at
the Red sea. 106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
make his mighty power to be known. 106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
through the depths, as through the wilderness. 106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them
left. 106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
the desert. 106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
soul. 106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
LORD. 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
company of Abiram. 106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
the wicked. 106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass. 106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
Egypt;

106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
Red sea. 106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
should destroy them. 106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
word:

106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
of the LORD. 106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them
in the wilderness:

106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
them in the lands. 106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
sacrifices of the dead. 106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
plague brake in upon them. 106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
plague was stayed. 106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
generations for evermore. 106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes:

106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips. 106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
commanded them:

106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. 106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils,

106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and
the land was polluted with blood. 106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
with their own inventions. 106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them. 106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
subjection under their hand. 106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
cry:

106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
to the multitude of his mercies. 106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives. 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. 107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy;

107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
west, from the north, and from the south. 107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
city to dwell in. 107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered
them out of their distresses. 107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a
city of habitation. 107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness. 107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
in affliction and iron;

107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
the counsel of the most High:

107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
down, and there was none to help. 107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
them out of their distresses. 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
brake their bands in sunder. 107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
in sunder. 107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
iniquities, are afflicted. 107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
unto the gates of death. 107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
them out of their distresses. 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
their destructions. 107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
declare his works with rejoicing. 107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
great waters;

107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
up the waves thereof. 107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
their soul is melted because of trouble. 107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
at their wit's end. 107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
them out of their distresses. 107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
still. 107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
unto their desired haven. 107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
praise him in the assembly of the elders. 107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
dry ground;

107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein. 107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
into watersprings. 107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
a city for habitation;

107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits
of increase. 107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
affliction, and sorrow. 107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness, where there is no way. 107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
families like a flock. 107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth. 107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. 108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
my glory. 108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
praises unto thee among the nations. 108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds. 108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
all the earth;

108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and
answer me. 108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
Philistia will I triumph. 108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom? 108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
O God, go forth with our hosts? 108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
tread down our enemies. 109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
against me without a cause. 109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
prayer. 109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand. 109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
prayer become sin. 109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office. 109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
seek their bread also out of their desolate places. 109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
strangers spoil his labour. 109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
be any to favour his fatherless children. 109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
let their name be blotted out. 109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
the memory of them from the earth. 109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
not in blessing, so let it be far from him. 109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so
let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
of them that speak evil against my soul. 109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. 109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and
down as the locust. 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
fatness. 109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
they shaked their heads. 109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
done it. 109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
praise him among the multitude. 109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
from those that condemn his soul. 110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool. 110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
thou in the midst of thine enemies. 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew
of thy youth. 110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedek. 110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
of his wrath. 110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with
the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. 110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift
up the head. 111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
have pleasure therein. 111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
endureth for ever. 111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
gracious and full of compassion. 111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
mindful of his covenant. 111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
give them the heritage of the heathen. 111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
commandments are sure. 111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
uprightness. 111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise
endureth for ever. 112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
that delighteth greatly in his commandments. 112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
upright shall be blessed. 112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
endureth for ever. 112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
affairs with discretion. 112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in
everlasting remembrance. 112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
trusting in the LORD. 112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
his desire upon his enemies. 112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. 112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. 113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
the name of the LORD. 113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore. 113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
LORD's name is to be praised. 113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
heavens. 113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
and in the earth! 113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
out of the dunghill;

113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
people. 113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. 114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people
of strange language;

114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
lambs. 114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back? 114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
like lambs? 114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
presence of the God of Jacob;

114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
fountain of waters. 115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory,
for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. 115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? 115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
pleased. 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
see not:

115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
smell not:

115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
trusteth in them. 115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
shield. 115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their
shield. 115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
their shield. 115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
children. 115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
hath he given to the children of men. 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
silence. 115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore. Praise the LORD. 116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
supplications. 116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live. 116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,
deliver my soul. 116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped
me. 116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
bountifully with thee. 116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling. 116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars. 116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
me? 116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
LORD. 116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people. 116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
call upon the name of the LORD. 116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people. 116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. 117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD. 118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
endureth for ever. 118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
ever. 118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for
ever. 118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
set me in a large place. 118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
me? 118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall
I see my desire upon them that hate me. 118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
princes. 118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
will I destroy them. 118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 118:12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
helped me. 118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
LORD doeth valiantly. 118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
unto death. 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and
I will praise the LORD:

118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. 118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
salvation. 118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
of the corner. 118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. 118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
be glad in it. 118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
now prosperity. 118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice
with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
will exalt thee. 118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
LORD. 119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
with the whole heart. 119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. 119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! 119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
commandments. 119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
learned thy righteous judgments. 119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
thereto according to thy word. 119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
from thy commandments. 119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
thee. 119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
all riches. 119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
ways. 119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
word. 119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
thy word. 119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
thy law. 119:19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
me. 119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
judgments at all times. 119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
thy commandments. 119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
testimonies. 119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
meditate in thy statutes. 119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth. 119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
thy word. 119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
statutes. 119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
of thy wondrous works. 119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
unto thy word. 119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
graciously. 119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
before me. 119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. 119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge
my heart. 119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
unto the end. 119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
observe it with my whole heart. 119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
delight. 119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. 119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
in thy way. 119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. 119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good. 119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
righteousness. 119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
according to thy word. 119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
for I trust in thy word. 119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
have hoped in thy judgments. 119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. 119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. 119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not
be ashamed. 119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
loved. 119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. 119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
me to hope. 119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
quickened me. 119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
declined from thy law. 119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
myself. 119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
forsake thy law. 119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept
thy law. 119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts. 119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
words. 119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me
according to thy word. 119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. 119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
forgotten thy law. 119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
righteous judgments. 119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
keep thy precepts. 119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. 119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
thy word. 119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
commandments. 119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
word. 119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
precepts with my whole heart. 119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. 119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
learn thy statutes. 119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
and silver. 119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,
that I may learn thy commandments. 119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
have hoped in thy word. 119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
faithfulness hast afflicted me. 119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
according to thy word unto thy servant. 119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
law is my delight. 119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. 119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
known thy testimonies. 119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. 119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. 119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? 119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget
thy statutes. 119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me? 119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law. 119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
wrongfully; help thou me. 119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
precepts. 119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
testimony of thy mouth. 119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. 119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established
the earth, and it abideth. 119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
are thy servants. 119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
perished in mine affliction. 119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
quickened me. 119:94 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts. 119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
consider thy testimonies. 119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
exceeding broad. 119:97 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
enemies: for they are ever with me. 119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
testimonies are my meditation. 119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
precepts. 119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
keep thy word. 119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
me. 119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
to my mouth! 119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
every false way. 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
righteous judgments. 119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
thy word. 119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
LORD, and teach me thy judgments. 119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
law. 119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
precepts. 119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
are the rejoicing of my heart. 119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
unto the end. 119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. 119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
of my God. 119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
not be ashamed of my hope. 119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
unto thy statutes continually. 119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
for their deceit is falsehood. 119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
therefore I love thy testimonies. 119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
judgments. 119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
oppressors. 119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
me. 119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
righteousness. 119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
thy statutes. 119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
testimonies. 119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
thy law. 119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
gold. 119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
be right; and I hate every false way. 119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
them. 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
understanding unto the simple. 119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
commandments. 119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
do unto those that love thy name. 119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
dominion over me. 119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
precepts. 119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
statutes. 119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
law. 119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. 119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
very faithful. 119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
thy words. 119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. 119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. 119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
is the truth. 119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
commandments are my delights. 119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
understanding, and I shall live. 119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
statutes. 119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. 119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
thy word. 119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
thy word. 119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
quicken me according to thy judgment. 119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
thy law. 119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. 119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
founded them for ever. 119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
thy law. 119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
word. 119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
statutes. 119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
thy judgments. 119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
from thy testimonies. 119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
not thy word. 119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
according to thy lovingkindness. 119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
righteous judgments endureth for ever. 119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
standeth in awe of thy word. 119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. 119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. 119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
judgments. 119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
offend them. 119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
commandments. 119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
exceedingly. 119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
are before thee. 119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
understanding according to thy word. 119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
thy word. 119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
statutes. 119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
are righteousness. 119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
delight. 119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
judgments help me. 119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
do not forget thy commandments. 120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
tongue. 120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,
thou false tongue? 120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
of Kedar! 120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. 121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
help. 121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
will not slumber. 121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
hand. 121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
thy soul. 121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
this time forth, and even for evermore. 122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
the LORD. 122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house
of David. 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
thee. 122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 122:8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be
within thee. 122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good. 123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
heavens. 123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
exceedingly filled with contempt. 123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. 124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel
say;

124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
up against us:

124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
kindled against us:

124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
soul:

124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
teeth. 124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot
be removed, but abideth for ever. 125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
about his people from henceforth even for ever. 125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
upright in their hearts. 125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be
upon Israel. 126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
them that dream. 126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great
things for them. 126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. 127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build
it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. 127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
womb is his reward. 127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
the youth. 127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. 128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his
ways. 128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
be, and it shall be well with thee. 128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
LORD. 128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
Israel. 129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now
say:

129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have
not prevailed against me. 129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
wicked. 129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
afore it groweth up:

129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
sheaves his bosom. 129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. 130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of
my supplications. 130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand? 130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
hope. 130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
and with him is plenteous redemption. 130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. 131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I
exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. 132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
Jacob;

132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
up into my bed;

132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,

132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
mighty God of Jacob. 132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the
wood. 132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
footstool. 132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
saints shout for joy. 132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
anointed. 132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for
evermore. 132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
habitation. 132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired
it.
