18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
stay. 18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
because he delighted in me. 18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
departed from my God. 18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
statutes from me. 18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
iniquity. 18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. 18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward. 18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
high looks. 18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
darkness. 18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
leaped over a wall. 18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. 18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? 18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
perfect. 18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high
places. 18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms. 18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. 18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. 18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
turn again till they were consumed. 18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
fallen under my feet. 18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me. 18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
destroy them that hate me. 18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD,
but he answered them not. 18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not
known shall serve me. 18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
shall submit themselves unto me. 18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
places. 18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
salvation be exalted. 18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. 18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the
violent man. 18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
his handywork. 19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge. 19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth
as a strong man to run a race. 19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments
of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
there is great reward. 19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
faults. 19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not
have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be
innocent from the great transgression. 19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. 20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of
Jacob defend thee;

20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
Zion;

20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
Selah. 20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
counsel. 20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we
will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember
the name of the LORD our God. 20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
upright. 20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call. 21:1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation
how greatly shall he rejoice! 21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden
the request of his lips. Selah. 21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
settest a crown of pure gold on his head. 21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
days for ever and ever. 21:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him. 21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance. 21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the
most High he shall not be moved. 21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall
find out those that hate thee. 21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger:
the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour
them. 21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of men. 21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous
device, which they are not able to perform. 21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt
make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. 21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
and praise thy power. 22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? 22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the
night season, and am not silent. 22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
them. 22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,
and were not confounded. 22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
the people. 22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,
they shake the head, saying,

22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver
him, seeing he delighted in him. 22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me
hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. 22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
mother's belly. 22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
help. 22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset
me round. 22:13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
roaring lion. 22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth
to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. 22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. 22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. 22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
to help me. 22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
dog. 22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
horns of the unicorns. 22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
congregation will I praise thee. 22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. 22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried
unto him, he heard. 22:25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay
my vows before them that fear him. 22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD
that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. 22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:
and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the
nations. 22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they
that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive
his own soul. 22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
generation. 22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
people that shall be born, that he hath done this. 23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside
the still waters. 23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his name's sake. 23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me. 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. 24:1 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
they that dwell therein. 24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the
floods. 24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in
his holy place? 24:4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted
up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 24:5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
from the God of his salvation. 24:6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face,
O Jacob. Selah. 24:7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 24:8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD
mighty in battle. 24:9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of
glory. Selah. 25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
enemies triumph over me. 25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause. 25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. 25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
for they have been ever of old. 25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O
LORD. 25:8 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in
the way. 25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
his way. 25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies. 25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
great. 25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose. 25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
earth. 25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
shew them his covenant. 25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
out of the net. 25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
afflicted. 25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my
distresses. 25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. 25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with
cruel hatred. 25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put
my trust in thee. 25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. 25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. 26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. 26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 26:3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in
thy truth. 26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
dissemblers. 26:5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
with the wicked. 26:6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
altar, O LORD:

26:7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
all thy wondrous works. 26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
where thine honour dwelleth. 26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

26:10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
bribes. 26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be
merciful unto me. 26:12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
bless the LORD. 27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 27:2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to
eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. 27:3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. 27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to
behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. 27:5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in
the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon
a rock. 27:6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;
I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. 27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me,
and answer me. 27:8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy
face, LORD, will I seek. 27:9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger:
thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
salvation. 27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take
me up. 27:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
of mine enemies. 27:12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 27:13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the
LORD in the land of the living. 27:14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. 28:1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest,
if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I
lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. 28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in
their hearts. 28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their
hands; render to them their desert. 28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation
of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. 28:6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
supplications. 28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,
and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my
song will I praise him. 28:8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
anointed. 28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and
lift them up for ever. 29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
strength. 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD
in the beauty of holiness. 29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full
of majesty. 29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
the cedars of Lebanon. 29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like
a young unicorn. 29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
the wilderness of Kadesh. 29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth
the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
ever. 29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless
his people with peace. 30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over me. 30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness. 30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. 30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. 30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:
thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. 30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication. 30:9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. 30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put
off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. 31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
deliver me in thy righteousness. 31:2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong
rock, for an house of defence to save me. 31:3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
sake lead me, and guide me. 31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
thou art my strength. 31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
God of truth. 31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
LORD. 31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered
my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set
my feet in a large room. 31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. 31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me
without fled from me. 31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
vessel. 31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away
my life. 31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. 31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies, and from them that persecute me. 31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
mercies' sake. 31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let
the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. 31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 31:19 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee
before the sons of men! 31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
strife of tongues. 31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city. 31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
unto thee. 31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. 31:24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
that hope in the LORD. 32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
covered. 32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
in whose spirit there is no guile. 32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
the day long. 32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
turned into the drought of summer. Selah. 32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they
shall not come nigh unto him. 32:7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
go: I will guide thee with mine eye. 32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest
they come near unto thee. 32:10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the
LORD, mercy shall compass him about. 32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
joy, all ye that are upright in heart. 33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the
upright. 33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings. 33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise. 33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in
truth. 33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
goodness of the LORD. 33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host
of them by the breath of his mouth. 33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth
up the depth in storehouses. 33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the
world stand in awe of him. 33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. 33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
maketh the devices of the people of none effect. 33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
heart to all generations. 33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom
he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. 33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
inhabitants of the earth. 33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
works. 33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man
is not delivered by much strength. 33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
any by his great strength. 33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
them that hope in his mercy;

33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
famine. 33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
his holy name. 33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. 34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually
be in my mouth. 34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear
thereof, and be glad. 34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears. 34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
not ashamed. 34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
all his troubles. 34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
and delivereth them. 34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
trusteth in him. 34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that
fear him. 34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
the LORD shall not want any good thing. 34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of
the LORD. 34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he
may see good? 34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their cry. 34:16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
the remembrance of them from the earth. 34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out
of all their troubles. 34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
delivereth him out of them all. 34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. 34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
shall be desolate. 34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
that trust in him shall be desolate. 35:1 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
against them that fight against me. 35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. 35:3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. 35:4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:
let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. 35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
LORD chase them. 35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD
persecute them. 35:7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which
without cause they have digged for my soul. 35:8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that
he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. 35:9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his
salvation. 35:10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor
and the needy from him that spoileth him? 35:11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that
I knew not. 35:12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul. 35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I
humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own
bosom. 35:14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. 35:15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me,
and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:

35:16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
their teeth. 35:17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
destructions, my darling from the lions. 35:18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise
thee among much people. 35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. 35:20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
against them that are quiet in the land. 35:21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
aha, our eye hath seen it. 35:22 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
far from me. 35:23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
my God and my Lord. 35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let
them not rejoice over me. 35:25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
them not say, We have swallowed him up. 35:26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour
that magnify themselves against me. 35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 35:28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise
all the day long. 36:1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there
is no fear of God before his eyes. 36:2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
found to be hateful. 36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off
to be wise, and to do good. 36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. 36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
reacheth unto the clouds. 36:6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are
a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 36:7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. 36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
light. 36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
righteousness to the upright in heart. 36:11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand
of the wicked remove me. 36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
and shall not be able to rise. 37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity. 37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
green herb. 37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,
and verily thou shalt be fed. 37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
desires of thine heart. 37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
bring it to pass. 37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday. 37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass. 37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise
to do evil. 37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
LORD, they shall inherit the earth. 37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. 37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
themselves in the abundance of peace. 37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with
his teeth. 37:13 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
coming. 37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to
cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright
conversation. 37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
shall be broken. 37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
many wicked. 37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
upholdeth the righteous. 37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance
shall be for ever. 37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
famine they shall be satisfied. 37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they
consume away. 37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
sheweth mercy, and giveth. 37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they
that be cursed of him shall be cut off. 37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
delighteth in his way. 37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD
upholdeth him with his hand. 37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. 37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. 37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. 37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they
are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off. 37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
ever. 37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
talketh of judgment. 37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
slide. 37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. 37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he
is judged. 37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. 37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
like a green bay tree. 37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but
he could not be found. 37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
that man is peace. 37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
the wicked shall be cut off. 37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
strength in the time of trouble. 37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver
them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. 38:1 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure. 38:2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. 38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 38:4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden
they are too heavy for me. 38:5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness. 38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
long. 38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no
soundness in my flesh. 38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my heart. 38:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
from thee. 38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
kinsmen stand afar off. 38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all
the day long. 38:13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
openeth not his mouth. 38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no
reproofs. 38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. 38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that
hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
because I follow the thing that good is. 38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. 38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. 39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before
me. 39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my
sorrow was stirred. 39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:
then spake I with my tongue,

39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what
it is: that I may know how frail I am. 39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is
as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is
altogether vanity. Selah. 39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall
gather them. 39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee. 39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach
of the foolish. 39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it. 39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
thine hand. 39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is
vanity. Selah. 39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as
all my fathers were. 39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and
be no more. 40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
heard my cry. 40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. 40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are
more than can be numbered. 40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. 40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written
of me,

40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
heart. 40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. 40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation. 40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. 40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are
more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. 40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
me. 40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that
wish me evil. 40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
me, Aha, aha. 40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified. 40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art
my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God. 41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
him in time of trouble. 41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be
blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of
his enemies. 41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
wilt make all his bed in his sickness. 41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
sinned against thee. 41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
perish? 41:6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth
iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it. 41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they
devise my hurt. 41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that
he lieth he shall rise up no more. 41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. 41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
may requite them. 41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
not triumph over me. 41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest
me before thy face for ever. 41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
everlasting. Amen, and Amen. 42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
after thee, O God. 42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come
and appear before God? 42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually
say unto me, Where is thy God? 42:4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had
gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with
the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. 42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in
me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance. 42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the
hill Mizar. 42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me. 42:8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and
in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of
my life. 42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 42:10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
they say daily unto me, Where is thy God? 42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
health of my countenance, and my God. 43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles. 43:4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:
yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. 43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health
of my countenance, and my God. 44:1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. 44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out. 44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine
arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour
unto them. 44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob. 44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will
we tread them under that rise up against us. 44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. 44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
shame that hated us. 44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. 44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth
with our armies. 44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate
us spoil for themselves. 44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
scattered us among the heathen. 44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
wealth by their price. 44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
derision to them that are round about us. 44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head
among the people. 44:15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face
hath covered me,

44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason
of the enemy and avenger. 44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
from thy way;

44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
covered us with the shadow of death. 44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
hands to a strange god;

44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
heart. 44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted
as sheep for the slaughter. 44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
ever. 44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
and our oppression? 44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto
the earth. 44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake. 45:1 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I
have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 45:3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and
thy majesty. 45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee
terrible things. 45:5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
whereby the people fall under thee. 45:6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
kingdom is a right sceptre. 45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows. 45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad. 45:9 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right
hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget
also thine own people, and thy father's house;

45:11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord;
and worship thou him. 45:12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
rich among the people shall intreat thy favour. 45:13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
wrought gold. 45:14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the
virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. 45:15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
enter into the king's palace. 45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
make princes in all the earth. 45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever. 46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 46:2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

46:3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah. 46:4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. 46:5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
help her, and that right early. 46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice,
the earth melted. 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
in the earth. 46:9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in
the fire. 46:10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 47:1 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice
of triumph. 47:2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all
the earth. 47:3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
feet. 47:4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob
whom he loved. Selah. 47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
trumpet. 47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
sing praises. 47:7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
understanding. 47:8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his
holiness. 47:9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people
of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God:
he is greatly exalted. 48:1 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our
God, in the mountain of his holiness. 48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together. 48:5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
hasted away. 48:6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
travail. 48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah. 48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
temple. 48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of
the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
because of thy judgments. 48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
thereof. 48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
tell it to the generation following. 48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
even unto death. 49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
world:

49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together. 49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
shall be of understanding. 49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying
upon the harp. 49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of
my heels shall compass me about? 49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches;

49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God
a ransom for him:

49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
ever:)

49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. 49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their
lands after their own names. 49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
beasts that perish. 49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their
sayings. Selah. 49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;
and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and
their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. 49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he
shall receive me. Selah. 49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
house is increased;

49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
not descend after him. 49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
thee, when thou doest well to thyself. 49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
see light. 49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts
that perish. 50:1 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth
from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. 50:3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him. 50:4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that
he may judge his people. 50:5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
covenant with me by sacrifice. 50:6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge
himself. Selah. 50:7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify
against thee: I am God, even thy God. 50:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
offerings, to have been continually before me. 50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy
folds. 50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
thousand hills. 50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
the field are mine. 50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine,
and the fulness thereof. 50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? 50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
High:

50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me. 50:16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? 50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
thee. 50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
hast been partaker with adulterers. 50:19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 50:20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
thine own mother's son. 50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,
and set them in order before thine eyes. 50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
pieces, and there be none to deliver. 50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God. 51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions. 51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
me. 51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
clear when thou judgest. 51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
conceive me. 51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall
be whiter than snow. 51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice. 51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me. 51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
from me. 51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
free spirit. 51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
converted unto thee. 51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
praise. 51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
delightest not in burnt offering. 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
Jerusalem. 51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer
bullocks upon thine altar. 52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness
of God endureth continually. 52:2 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
deceitfully. 52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
righteousness. Selah. 52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. 52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of
the land of the living. Selah. 52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:

52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness. 52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in
the mercy of God for ever and ever. 52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints. 53:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth
good. 53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, that did seek God. 53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
as they eat bread: they have not called upon God. 53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put
them to shame, because God hath despised them. 53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and
Israel shall be glad. 54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after
my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 54:4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
soul. 54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
truth. 54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
LORD; for it is good. 54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies. 55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
supplication. 55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a
noise;

55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of
the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. 55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me. 55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
overwhelmed me. 55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
away, and be at rest. 55:7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. 55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. 55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
violence and strife in the city. 55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it. 55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not
from her streets. 55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance. 55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God
in company. 55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:
for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. 55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. 55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
and he shall hear my voice. 55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
against me: for there were many with me. 55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
him: he hath broken his covenant. 55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in
his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days; but I will trust in thee. 56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
fighting daily oppresseth me. 56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
fight against me, O thou most High. 56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
not fear what flesh can do unto me. 56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me
for evil. 56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark
my steps, when they wait for my soul. 56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
people, O God. 56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
are they not in thy book? 56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I
know; for God is for me. 56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
word. 56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
unto me. 56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light
of the living? 57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my
refuge, until these calamities be overpast. 57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
things for me. 57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and
his truth. 57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on
fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and
their tongue a sharp sword. 57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above
all the earth. 57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
fallen themselves. Selah. 57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
praise. 57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
early. 57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
thee among the nations. 57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
clouds. 57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
above all the earth. 58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
uprightly, O ye sons of men? 58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your
hands in the earth. 58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as
they be born, speaking lies. 58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the
deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never
so wisely. 58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 58:7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like
the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. 58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as
with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. 58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. 59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that
rise up against me. 59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody
men. 59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help
me, and behold. 59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to
visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
round about the city. 59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
lips: for who, say they, doth hear? 59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
heathen in derision. 59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
defence. 59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
desire upon mine enemies. 59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power;
and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them
even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they
speak. 59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a
dog, and go round about the city. 59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not
satisfied. 59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the
day of my trouble. 59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
and the God of my mercy. 60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast
been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
drink the wine of astonishment. 60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed because of the truth. Selah. 60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and
hear me. 60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,
triumph thou because of me. 60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom? 60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,
which didst not go out with our armies? 60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread
down our enemies. 61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
enemy. 61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
covert of thy wings. Selah. 61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
heritage of those that fear thy name. 61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
generations. 61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
which may preserve him. 61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
perform my vows. 62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. 62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
not be greatly moved. 62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering
fence. 62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. 62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
not be moved. 62:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and
my refuge, is in God. 62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. 62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than
vanity. 62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
riches increase, set not your heart upon them. 62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
belongeth unto God. 62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
every man according to his work. 63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth
for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where
no water is;

63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
sanctuary. 63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
praise thee. 63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in
thy name. 63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
night watches. 63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
wings will I rejoice. 63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. 63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
lower parts of the earth. 63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be
stopped. 64:1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of
the enemy. 64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot
their arrows, even bitter words:

64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
shoot at him, and fear not. 64:5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 64:7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
wounded. 64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all
that see them shall flee away. 64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
they shall wisely consider of his doing. 64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;
and all the upright in heart shall glory. 65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the
vow be performed. 65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. 65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
shalt purge them away. 65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with
the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. 65:5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of
our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
with power:

65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,
and the tumult of the people. 65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
rejoice. 65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest
it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them
corn, when thou hast so provided for it. 65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the
springing thereof. 65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
fatness. 65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
hills rejoice on every side. 65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing. 66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. 66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto
thee. 66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they
shall sing to thy name. Selah. 66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward
the children of men. 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on
foot: there did we rejoice in him. 66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let
not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. 66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to
be heard:

66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
moved. 66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
is tried. 66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
loins. 66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
place. 66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
my vows,

66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was
in trouble. 66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. 66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
hath done for my soul. 66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
tongue. 66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

66:19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
my prayer. 66:20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
mercy from me. 67:1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
shine upon us; Selah. 67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all
nations. 67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
thee. 67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge
the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
thee. 67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
God, shall bless us. 67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him. 68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that
hate him flee before him. 68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea,
let them exceedingly rejoice. 68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. 68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in
his holy habitation. 68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which
are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land. 68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
march through the wilderness; Selah:

68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:
even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. 68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared
of thy goodness for the poor. 68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
published it. 68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
divided the spoil. 68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. 68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in
Salmon. 68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
hill of Bashan. 68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth
to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever. 68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place. 68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that
the LORD God might dwell among them. 68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
the God of our salvation. Selah. 68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
Lord belong the issues from death. 68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp
of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. 68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
people again from the depths of the sea:

68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
the tongue of thy dogs in the same. 68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my
King, in the sanctuary. 68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. 68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
fountain of Israel. 68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah
and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of
Naphtali. 68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
which thou hast wrought for us. 68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
unto thee. 68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with
the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of
silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war. 68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
her hands unto God. 68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the
Lord; Selah:

68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. 68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and
his strength is in the clouds. 68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed
be God. 69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. 69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into
deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while
I wait for my God. 69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are
mighty: then I restored that which I took not away. 69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
thee. 69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O
God of Israel. 69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
face. 69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
mother's children. 69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. 69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
reproach. 69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
them. 69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
of the drunkards. 69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of
thy salvation. 69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow
me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
hear me speedily. 69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
mine enemies. 69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
mine adversaries are all before thee. 69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I
looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters,
but I found none. 69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink. 69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. 69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
loins continually to shake. 69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them. 69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
tents. 69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy
righteousness. 69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
written with the righteous. 69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up
on high. 69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
with thanksgiving. 69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
that hath horns and hoofs. 69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
live that seek God. 69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. 69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
that moveth therein. 69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that
they may dwell there, and have it in possession. 69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
love his name shall dwell therein. 70:1 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD. 70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let
them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
Aha, aha. 70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let
such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my
help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying. 71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
confusion. 71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline
thine ear unto me, and save me. 71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my
fortress. 71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
youth. 71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of
thee. 71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. 71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
the day. 71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
strength faileth. 71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel together,

71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there
is none to deliver him. 71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. 71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
hurt. 71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
more. 71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. 71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
of thy righteousness, even of thine only. 71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
declared thy wondrous works. 71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power
to every one that is to come. 71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
things: O God, who is like unto thee! 71:20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
earth. 71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. 71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my
God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
soul, which thou hast redeemed. 71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my
hurt. 72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
the king's son. 72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
judgment. 72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
hills, by righteousness. 72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children
of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. 72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
throughout all generations. 72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that
water the earth. 72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace
so long as the moon endureth. 72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
unto the ends of the earth. 72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
enemies shall lick the dust. 72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
serve him. 72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
and him that hath no helper. 72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
the needy. 72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
precious shall their blood be in his sight. 72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall
he be praised. 72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of
the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall
call him blessed. 72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
wondrous things. 72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen. 72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. 73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
heart. 73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
slipped. 73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
the wicked. 73:4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
firm. 73:5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
like other men. 73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
covereth them as a garment. 73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
could wish. 73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they
speak loftily. 73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
walketh through the earth. 73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are
wrung out to them. 73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
most High? 73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
increase in riches. 73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
innocency. 73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
morning. 73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
generation of thy children. 73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
end. 73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
them down into destruction. 73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
utterly consumed with terrors. 73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
shalt despise their image. 73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. 73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. 73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by
my right hand. 73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
to glory. 73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
that I desire beside thee. 73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever. 73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. 73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. 74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger
smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the
rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,
wherein thou hast dwelt. 74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
their ensigns for signs. 74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
thick trees. 74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
and hammers. 74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. 74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
there among us any that knoweth how long. 74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
blaspheme thy name for ever? 74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out
of thy bosom. 74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the
earth. 74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters. 74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to
be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
mighty rivers. 74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
the light and the sun. 74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
summer and winter. 74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that
the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth
are full of the habitations of cruelty. 74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
praise thy name. 74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
man reproacheth thee daily. 74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that
rise up against thee increaseth continually. 75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. 75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear
up the pillars of it. Selah. 75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
Lift not up the horn:

75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. 75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
nor from the south. 75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
another. 75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;
it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs
thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink
them. 75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
Jacob. 75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted. 76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. 76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,
and the battle. Selah. 76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. 76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
none of the men of might have found their hands. 76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
cast into a dead sleep. 76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry? 76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
feared, and was still,

76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
wrath shalt thou restrain. 76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about
him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
kings of the earth. 77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and
he gave ear unto me. 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
