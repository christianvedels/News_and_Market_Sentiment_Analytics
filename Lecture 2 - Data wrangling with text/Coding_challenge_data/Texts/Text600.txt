96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
offering, and come into his courts. 96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
all the earth. 96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the
people righteously. 96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
roar, and the fulness thereof. 96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all
the trees of the wood rejoice

96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people
with his truth. 97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
isles be glad thereof. 97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
judgment are the habitation of his throne. 97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
trembled. 97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his
glory. 97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
because of thy judgments, O LORD. 97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
far above all gods. 97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his
saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
heart. 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness. 98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he
openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of
a psalm. 98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
LORD, the King. 98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
that dwell therein. 98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together

98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity. 99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the
cherubims; let the earth be moved. 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he
is holy. 99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
LORD our God is holy. 100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
singing. 100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations. 101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
sing. 101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of
them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
person. 101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him
that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that
telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut
off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. 102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. 102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as
an hearth. 102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
to eat my bread. 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
skin. 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
desert. 102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
against me are sworn against me. 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
weeping. 102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
lifted me up, and cast me down. 102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
like grass. 102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
unto all generations. 102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
dust thereof. 102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
kings of the earth thy glory. 102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
glory. 102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
their prayer. 102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
appointed to death;

102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
Jerusalem;

102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
serve the LORD. 102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy
years are throughout all generations. 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
heavens are the work of thy hands. 102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and
they shall be changed:

102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
shall be established before thee. 103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his
holy name. 103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases;

103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies;

103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is
renewed like the eagle's. 103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
oppressed. 103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
Israel. 103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
in mercy. 103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
ever. 103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities. 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
mercy toward them that fear him. 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us. 103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
that fear him. 103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so
he flourisheth. 103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
thereof shall know it no more. 103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
children;

103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
commandments to do them. 103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
kingdom ruleth over all. 103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
do his pleasure. 103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
bless the LORD, O my soul. 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
removed for ever. 104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
stood above the mountains. 104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
away. 104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
the place which thou hast founded for them. 104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
turn not again to cover the earth. 104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
hills. 104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
quench their thirst. 104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
which sing among the branches. 104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied
with the fruit of thy works. 104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. 104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
which he hath planted;

104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
trees are her house. 104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
for the conies. 104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
down. 104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth. 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
God. 104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
down in their dens. 104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
evening. 104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts. 104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
made to play therein. 104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat
in due season. 104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
they are filled with good. 104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their
breath, they die, and return to their dust. 104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
renewest the face of the earth. 104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
rejoice in his works. 104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
hills, and they smoke. 104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise
to my God while I have my being. 104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
LORD. 104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. 105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his
deeds among the people. 105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
works. 105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the LORD. 105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
and the judgments of his mouth;

105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
chosen. 105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations. 105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
an everlasting covenant:

105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
your inheritance:

105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
strangers in it. 105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
another people;

105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
their sakes;

105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
whole staff of bread. 105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
servant:

105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
him. 105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
let him go free. 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
wisdom. 105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
Ham. 105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
than their enemies. 105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
his servants. 105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
Ham. 105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
against his word. 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
their kings. 105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
their coasts. 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
trees of their coasts. 105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
without number,

105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
fruit of their ground. 105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
their strength. 105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
not one feeble person among their tribes. 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
upon them. 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
night. 105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
with the bread of heaven. 105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
dry places like a river. 105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
gladness:

105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
labour of the people;

105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise
ye the LORD. 106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
for his mercy endureth for ever. 106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
all his praise? 106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
righteousness at all times. 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;

106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
have done wickedly. 106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at
the Red sea. 106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
make his mighty power to be known. 106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
through the depths, as through the wilderness. 106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them
left. 106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
the desert. 106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
soul. 106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
LORD. 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
company of Abiram. 106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
the wicked. 106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass. 106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
Egypt;

106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
Red sea. 106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he
should destroy them. 106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
word:

106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
of the LORD. 106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them
in the wilderness:

106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
them in the lands. 106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
sacrifices of the dead. 106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
plague brake in upon them. 106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
plague was stayed. 106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
generations for evermore. 106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes:

106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips. 106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
commanded them:

106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. 106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils,

106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and
the land was polluted with blood. 106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
with their own inventions. 106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them. 106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
subjection under their hand. 106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
cry:

106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
to the multitude of his mercies. 106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives. 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. 107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy;

107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
west, from the north, and from the south. 107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
city to dwell in. 107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered
them out of their distresses. 107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a
city of habitation. 107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness. 107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
in affliction and iron;

107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
the counsel of the most High:

107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
down, and there was none to help. 107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
them out of their distresses. 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
brake their bands in sunder. 107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
in sunder. 107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
iniquities, are afflicted. 107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
unto the gates of death. 107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
them out of their distresses. 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
their destructions. 107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
declare his works with rejoicing. 107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
great waters;

107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
up the waves thereof. 107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
their soul is melted because of trouble. 107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
at their wit's end. 107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
them out of their distresses. 107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
still. 107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
unto their desired haven. 107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! 107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
praise him in the assembly of the elders. 107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
dry ground;

107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein. 107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
into watersprings. 107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
a city for habitation;

107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits
of increase. 107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
affliction, and sorrow. 107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness, where there is no way. 107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
families like a flock. 107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth. 107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. 108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
my glory. 108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
praises unto thee among the nations. 108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds. 108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
all the earth;

108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and
answer me. 108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
Philistia will I triumph. 108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
Edom? 108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
O God, go forth with our hosts? 108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
tread down our enemies. 109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
against me without a cause. 109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
prayer. 109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
hand. 109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
prayer become sin. 109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office. 109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
seek their bread also out of their desolate places. 109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
strangers spoil his labour. 109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
be any to favour his fatherless children. 109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
let their name be blotted out. 109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
the memory of them from the earth. 109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
not in blessing, so let it be far from him. 109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so
let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
of them that speak evil against my soul. 109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. 109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and
down as the locust. 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
fatness. 109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
they shaked their heads. 109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
done it. 109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
praise him among the multitude. 109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
from those that condemn his soul. 110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
make thine enemies thy footstool. 110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
thou in the midst of thine enemies. 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew
of thy youth. 110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedek. 110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
of his wrath. 110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with
the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. 110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift
up the head. 111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
have pleasure therein. 111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
endureth for ever. 111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
gracious and full of compassion. 111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
mindful of his covenant. 111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
give them the heritage of the heathen. 111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
commandments are sure. 111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
uprightness. 111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise
endureth for ever. 112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
that delighteth greatly in his commandments. 112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
upright shall be blessed. 112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
endureth for ever. 112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
affairs with discretion. 112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in
everlasting remembrance. 112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
trusting in the LORD. 112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
his desire upon his enemies. 112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. 112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. 113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
the name of the LORD. 113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore. 113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
LORD's name is to be praised. 113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
heavens. 113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
and in the earth! 113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
out of the dunghill;

113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
people. 113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. 114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people
of strange language;

114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
lambs. 114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
that thou wast driven back? 114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
like lambs? 114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
presence of the God of Jacob;

114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
fountain of waters. 115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory,
for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. 115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? 115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
pleased. 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
see not:

115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
smell not:

115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
trusteth in them. 115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
shield. 115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their
shield. 115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
their shield. 115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
children. 115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
hath he given to the children of men. 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
silence. 115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
evermore. Praise the LORD. 116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
supplications. 116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call
upon him as long as I live. 116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,
deliver my soul. 116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped
me. 116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
bountifully with thee. 116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling. 116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars. 116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
me? 116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
LORD. 116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people. 116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
call upon the name of the LORD. 116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
people. 116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. 117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD. 118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
endureth for ever. 118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
ever. 118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for
ever. 118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
set me in a large place. 118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
me? 118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall
I see my desire upon them that hate me. 118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
princes. 118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
will I destroy them. 118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 118:12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
helped me. 118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
LORD doeth valiantly. 118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
unto death. 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and
I will praise the LORD:

118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. 118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
salvation. 118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
of the corner. 118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. 118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
be glad in it. 118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
now prosperity. 118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice
with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
will exalt thee. 118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
LORD. 119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
with the whole heart. 119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. 119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! 119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
commandments. 119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
learned thy righteous judgments. 119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
thereto according to thy word. 119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
from thy commandments. 119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
thee. 119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
all riches. 119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
ways. 119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
word. 119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
thy word. 119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
thy law. 119:19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
me. 119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
judgments at all times. 119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
thy commandments. 119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
testimonies. 119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
meditate in thy statutes. 119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth. 119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
thy word. 119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
statutes. 119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
of thy wondrous works. 119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
unto thy word. 119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
graciously. 119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
before me. 119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. 119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge
my heart. 119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
unto the end. 119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
observe it with my whole heart. 119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
delight. 119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. 119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
in thy way. 119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. 119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good. 119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
righteousness. 119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
according to thy word. 119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
for I trust in thy word. 119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
have hoped in thy judgments. 119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. 119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. 119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not
be ashamed. 119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
loved. 119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. 119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
me to hope. 119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
quickened me. 119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
declined from thy law. 119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
myself. 119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
forsake thy law. 119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept
thy law. 119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts. 119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
words. 119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me
according to thy word. 119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. 119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
forgotten thy law. 119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
righteous judgments. 119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
keep thy precepts. 119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. 119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
thy word. 119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
commandments. 119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
word. 119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
precepts with my whole heart. 119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. 119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
learn thy statutes. 119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
and silver. 119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,
that I may learn thy commandments. 119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
have hoped in thy word. 119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
faithfulness hast afflicted me. 119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
according to thy word unto thy servant. 119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
law is my delight. 119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. 119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
known thy testimonies. 119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. 119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. 119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? 119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget
thy statutes. 119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me? 119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law. 119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
wrongfully; help thou me. 119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
precepts. 119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
testimony of thy mouth. 119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. 119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established
the earth, and it abideth. 119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
are thy servants. 119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
perished in mine affliction. 119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
quickened me. 119:94 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts. 119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
consider thy testimonies. 119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
exceeding broad. 119:97 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
enemies: for they are ever with me. 119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
testimonies are my meditation. 119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
precepts. 119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
keep thy word. 119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
me. 119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
to my mouth! 119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
every false way. 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
righteous judgments. 119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
thy word. 119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
LORD, and teach me thy judgments. 119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
law. 119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
precepts. 119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
are the rejoicing of my heart. 119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
unto the end. 119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. 119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
of my God. 119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
not be ashamed of my hope. 119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
unto thy statutes continually. 119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
for their deceit is falsehood. 119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
therefore I love thy testimonies. 119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
judgments. 119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
oppressors. 119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
me. 119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
righteousness. 119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
thy statutes. 119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
testimonies. 119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
thy law. 119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
gold. 119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
be right; and I hate every false way. 119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
them. 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
understanding unto the simple. 119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
commandments. 119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
do unto those that love thy name. 119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
dominion over me. 119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
precepts. 119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
statutes. 119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
law. 119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. 119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
very faithful. 119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
thy words. 119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. 119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. 119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
is the truth. 119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
commandments are my delights. 119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
understanding, and I shall live. 119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
statutes. 119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. 119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
thy word. 119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
thy word. 119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
quicken me according to thy judgment. 119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
thy law. 119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. 119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
founded them for ever. 119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
thy law. 119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
word. 119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
statutes. 119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
thy judgments. 119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
from thy testimonies. 119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
not thy word. 119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
according to thy lovingkindness. 119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
righteous judgments endureth for ever. 119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
standeth in awe of thy word. 119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. 119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. 119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
judgments. 119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
offend them. 119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
commandments. 119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
exceedingly. 119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
are before thee. 119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
understanding according to thy word. 119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
thy word. 119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
statutes. 119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
are righteousness. 119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
delight. 119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
judgments help me. 119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
do not forget thy commandments. 120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
tongue. 120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,
thou false tongue? 120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
of Kedar! 120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. 121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
help. 121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
will not slumber. 121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
hand. 121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
thy soul. 121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
this time forth, and even for evermore. 122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
the LORD. 122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house
of David. 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
thee. 122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 122:8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be
within thee. 122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good. 123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
heavens. 123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
exceedingly filled with contempt. 123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. 124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel
say;

124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
up against us:

124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
kindled against us:

124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
soul:

124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
teeth. 124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot
be removed, but abideth for ever. 125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
about his people from henceforth even for ever. 125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
upright in their hearts. 125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be
upon Israel. 126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
them that dream. 126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great
things for them. 126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. 127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build
it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. 127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
womb is his reward. 127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
the youth. 127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. 128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his
ways. 128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
be, and it shall be well with thee. 128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
LORD. 128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
Israel. 129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now
say:

129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have
not prevailed against me. 129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
wicked. 129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
afore it groweth up:

129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
sheaves his bosom. 129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. 130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of
my supplications. 130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
stand? 130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
hope. 130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
and with him is plenteous redemption. 130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. 131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I
exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. 132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
Jacob;

132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
up into my bed;

132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,

132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
mighty God of Jacob. 132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the
wood. 132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
footstool. 132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
saints shout for joy. 132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
anointed. 132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for
evermore. 132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
habitation. 132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired
it. 132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
with bread. 132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
shall shout aloud for joy. 132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
lamp for mine anointed. 132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
his crown flourish. 133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity! 133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of
his garments;

133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even
life for evermore. 134:1 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by
night stand in the house of the LORD. 134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD. 134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion. 135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him,
O ye servants of the LORD. 135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
house of our God. 135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
name; for it is pleasant. 135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his
peculiar treasure. 135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
all gods. 135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he
maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his
treasuries. 135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
kingdoms of Canaan:

135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
his people. 135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
throughout all generations. 135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
concerning his servants. 135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's
hands. 135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
see not;

135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
in their mouths. 135:18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
trusteth in them. 135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
Aaron:

135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
the LORD. 135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 136:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 136:2 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
ever. 136:3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
ever. 136:4 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for
ever. 136:5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
for ever. 136:6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
mercy endureth for ever. 136:7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for
ever. 136:10 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
endureth for ever:

136:11 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
for ever:

136:12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 136:13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
endureth for ever:

136:14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
endureth for ever:

136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
mercy endureth for ever. 136:16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
mercy endureth for ever. 136:17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
ever:

136:18 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:20 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for
ever:

136:22 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
endureth for ever. 136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for
ever:

136:24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
for ever. 136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
for ever. 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when
we remembered Zion. 137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us
one of the songs of Zion. 137:4 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land? 137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning. 137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem;
who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. 137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the stones. 138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
sing praise unto thee. 138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word
above all thy name. 138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
me with strength in my soul. 138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they
hear the words of thy mouth. 138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
glory of the LORD. 138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but
the proud he knoweth afar off. 138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou
shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and
thy right hand shall save me. 138:8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. 139:1 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. 139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
understandest my thought afar off. 139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
with all my ways. 139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
knowest it altogether. 139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
me. 139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
attain unto it. 139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from
thy presence? 139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in
hell, behold, thou art there. 139:9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea;

139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
hold me. 139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
shall be light about me. 139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. 139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
mother's womb. 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were
fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. 139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is
the sum of them! 139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
when I awake, I am still with thee. 139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
therefore, ye bloody men. 139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
thy name in vain. 139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
grieved with those that rise up against thee? 139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
thoughts:

139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
way everlasting. 140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
violent man;

140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
gathered together for war. 140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison
is under their lips. Selah. 140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from
the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a
net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. 140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
supplications, O LORD. 140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered
my head in the day of battle. 140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief
of their own lips cover them. 140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall
hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
and the right of the poor. 140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
upright shall dwell in thy presence. 141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
voice, when I cry unto thee. 141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. 141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works
with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 141:5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him
reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my
head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. 141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
hear my words; for they are sweet. 141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. 141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
trust; leave not my soul destitute. 141:9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
gins of the workers of iniquity. 141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
escape. 142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD
did I make my supplication. 142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
trouble. 142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
portion in the land of the living. 142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with
me. 143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. 143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified. 143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those
that have been long dead. 143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me
is desolate. 143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse
on the work of thy hands. 143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. 143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee
do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift
up my soul unto thee. 143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide
me. 143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
good; lead me into the land of uprightness. 143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness'
sake bring my soul out of trouble. 143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. 144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war,
and my fingers to fight:

144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son
of man, that thou makest account of him! 144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
away. 144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and
they shall smoke. 144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows,
and destroy them. 144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
waters, from the hand of strange children;

144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
hand of falsehood. 144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. 144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David
his servant from the hurtful sword. 144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose
mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of
falsehood:

144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude
of a palace:

144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
streets:

144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our
streets. 144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
that people, whose God is the LORD. 145:1 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for
ever and ever. 145:2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever
and ever. 145:3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness
is unsearchable. 145:4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
declare thy mighty acts. 145:5 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
wondrous works. 145:6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
will declare thy greatness. 145:7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
and shall sing of thy righteousness. 145:8 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and
of great mercy. 145:9 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his
works. 145:10 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
bless thee. 145:11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
power;

145:12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
glorious majesty of his kingdom. 145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
endureth throughout all generations. 145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that
be bowed down. 145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat
in due season. 145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
living thing. 145:17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
works. 145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
call upon him in truth. 145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
hear their cry, and will save them. 145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
will he destroy. 145:21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
bless his holy name for ever and ever. 146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my
God while I have any being. 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
there is no help. 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
day his thoughts perish. 146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
is in the LORD his God:

146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is:
which keepeth truth for ever:

146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to
the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

146:8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 146:10 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
generations. Praise ye the LORD. 147:1 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God;
for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. 147:2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
outcasts of Israel. 147:3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. 147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their
names. 147:5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
infinite. 147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the
ground. 147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp
unto our God:

147:8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the
earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
cry. 147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
pleasure in the legs of a man. 147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
hope in his mercy. 147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed
thy children within thee. 147:14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
finest of the wheat. 147:15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
very swiftly. 147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
ashes. 147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his
cold? 147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
to blow, and the waters flow. 147:19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
unto Israel. 147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments,
they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD. 148:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise
him in the heights. 148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
the heavens. 148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they
were created. 148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
decree which shall not pass. 148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
word:

148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
the earth:

148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. 148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise
ye the LORD. 149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
praise in the congregation of saints. 149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
Zion be joyful in their King. 149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
unto him with the timbrel and harp. 149:4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the
meek with salvation. 149:5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
their beds. 149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
sword in their hand;

149:7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
people;

149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
of iron;

149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all
his saints. Praise ye the LORD. 150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
the firmament of his power. 150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
excellent greatness. 150:3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
psaltery and harp. 150:4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed
instruments and organs. 150:5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
sounding cymbals. 150:6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD. The Proverbs


1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 1:2 To
know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and
equity; 1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge
and discretion. 1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 To understand a
proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark
sayings. 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
despise wisdom and instruction. 1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the
law of thy mother: 1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy
head, and chains about thy neck. 1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause: 1:12 Let us swallow them up
alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
with spoil: 1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from
their path: 1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed
blood. 1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
their own lives. 1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh
away the life of the owners thereof. 1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 1:22 How long,
ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in
their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 1:23 Turn you at my
reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known
my words unto you. 1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
hand, and no man regarded; 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my
counsel, and would none of my reproof: 1:26 I also will laugh at your
calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 When your fear
cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when
distress and anguish cometh upon you. 1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall
seek me early, but they shall not find me: 1:29 For that they hated
knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 1:30 They would
none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
filled with their own devices. 1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
quiet from fear of evil. 2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments
with thee; 2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply
thine heart to understanding; 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 2:4 If thou seekest her as
silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 Then shalt
thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
understanding. 2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to
them that walk uprightly. 2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his
saints. 2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
equity; yea, every good path. 2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul; 2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding
shall keep thee: 2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,
from the man that speaketh froward things; 2:13 Who leave the paths of
uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 Who rejoice to do
evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 2:15 Whose ways
are crooked, and they froward in their paths: 2:16 To deliver thee
from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with
her words; 2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth
the covenant of her God. 2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the
paths of life. 2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
of the righteous. 2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
remain in it. 2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
transgressors shall be rooted out of it. 3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
commandments: 3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall
they add to thee. 3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;
write them upon the table of thine heart: 3:4 So shalt thou find
favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine
own understanding. 3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
evil. 3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of
all thine increase: 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and
thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary
of his correction: 3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even
as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
understanding. 3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst
desire are not to be compared unto her. 3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches
and honour. 3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy
is every one that retaineth her. 3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath
he established the heavens. 3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
down the dew. 3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
and discretion: 3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to
thy neck. 3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
stumble. 3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt
lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
wicked, when it cometh. 3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
from being taken. 3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the
power of thine hand to do it. 3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I
will give; when thou hast it by thee. 3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
securely by thee. 3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
harm. 3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
with the righteous. 3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
blesseth the habitation of the just. 3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
lowly. 3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of
fools. 4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know
understanding. 4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 4:3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of
my mother. 4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
words: keep my commandments, and live. 4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from
the words of my mouth. 4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she
shall keep thee. 4:7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all
thy getting get understanding. 4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
honour, when thou dost embrace her. 4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
glory shall she deliver to thee. 4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life
shall be many. 4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
paths. 4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she
is thy life. 4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of
evil men. 4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. 4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. 4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
violence. 4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day. 4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they
stumble. 4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
thine heart. 4:22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
their flesh. 4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues
of life. 4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
from thee. 4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight
before thee. 4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. 4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from
evil. 5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
understanding: 5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy
lips may keep knowledge. 5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
mouth is smoother than oil: 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood,
sharp as a two-edged sword. 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
moveable, that thou canst not know them. 5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
words of my mouth. 5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
house: 5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
the cruel: 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy
labours be in the house of a stranger; 5:11 And thou mourn at the
last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 5:12 And say, How have
I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 5:13 And have not
obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that
instructed me! 5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the
congregation and assembly. 5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of
thine own well. 5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
the streets. 5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee. 5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
youth. 5:19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts
satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and
embrace the bosom of a stranger? 5:21 For the ways of man are before
the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be
holden with the cords of his sins. 5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
folly he shall go astray. 6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken
thy hand with a stranger, 6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thy
mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into
the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
bird from the hand of the fowler. 6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 6:7
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 6:8 Provideth her meat in
the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. 6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep? 6:10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to sleep: 6:11 So shall thy poverty come as one
that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. 6:12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth
with his fingers; 6:14 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth
mischief continually; he soweth discord. 6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be
broken without remedy. 6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
abomination unto him: 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands
that shed innocent blood, 6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked
imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 6:19 A false
witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 6:20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of
thy mother: 6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them
about thy neck. 6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall
keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs
of instruction are the way of life: 6:24 To keep thee from the evil
woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
thee with her eyelids. 6:26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life. 6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 6:29 So
he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall
not be innocent. 6:30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when
he is hungry; 6:31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he
shall give all the substance of his house. 6:32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding:
he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 6:33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be
wiped away. 6:34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in
the day of vengeance. 6:35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
though thou givest many gifts. 7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. 7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine
eye. 7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
heart. 7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy
kinswoman: 7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from
the stranger which flattereth with her words. 7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 7:7
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a
young man void of understanding, 7:8 Passing through the street near
her corner; and he went the way to her house, 7:9 In the twilight, in
the evening, in the black and dark night: 7:10 And, behold, there met
him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
