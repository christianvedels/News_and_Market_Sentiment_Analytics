# Today's lecture
.pull-left[
- Introduction to basic tools
- A lot of not so interesting things. But you can refer back to this. 

### What we will cover:
- `str` and what you can do with it
- Text cleaning (dealing with strange characters, stopwords, etc.)
  + Basics
  + Using `spaCy`
- Lexical resources (AFINN) 
- Classical sentiment analysis
- Coding challenge: Zipf's law

# A basic problem
Consider the headline 

> "Novo Nordisk reported a modest increase in earnings, but analysts remain cautious."

- "the," "a," and "in" are stopwords that don't provide financial context
- "earnings" and "cautious" are important terms for stock prediction 
- Removing stopwords helps focus on the financially relevant content

Noise in $\rightarrow$ noise out  
Clean data in $\rightarrow$ clean results out

# `str` object type
.pull-left-wide[
- Basic object type we will be working with

### Basic 
Let `a = "this_"` and `b = "string"`
- You can add strings together: `c = a + b` means that `print(c)` gives `"this_string"` 
- You can pick out parts of a string: `print(a[1])` is `"h"`
- Test: `"this" in c`: evaluates to `TRUE`


---
# List comprehension
.pull-left-wide[
- A `list` can contain strings. 
- As with any other list we can use list comprehension to manipulate it. 
- List comprehensions is a bit like a loop.
- We will use it a lot in text processing.

]

--

.pull-left[
### Loop
```{python}
input_strings = ["hello", "world"]
res = []
for x in input_strings:
  res.append(len(x))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
### List comprehension
```{python}
input_strings = ["hello", "world"]
res = [len(x) for x in input_strings]
```
]


---
# Lowercasing Text

.pull-left-wide[
**Why Lowercasing?**
- Consistency is key in text analysis.
- Reduces variations caused by capitalization (e.g., "Earnings" vs. "earnings").
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
**Example Code:**

```{python}
# Sample text
text = "Novo Nordisk reported a Modest INCREASE in Earnings."

# Convert text to lowercase
cleaned_text = text.lower()
print(cleaned_text)
```

]

---
# Removing Punctuation

.pull-left-wide[
**Why Remove Punctuation?**
- Punctuation often does not contribute to the meaning of the text.
- Helps focus on words rather than sentence structure.
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
**Example Code:**

```{python}
import string

# Sample text
text = "Earnings were up 20%! However, caution remains high."

# Remove punctuation
cleaned_text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
print(cleaned_text)
```

]

---
# Stripping Whitespace

.pull-left-wide[
**Why Normalize Whitespace?**
- Sometimes we want to avoid that spaces are assigned a meaning.
- Sometimes we want legible text
]


--

.pull-right-wide[
**Example Code:**

```{python}
# Sample text with extra whitespace
text = "   Earnings report:     Novo Nordisk shows increase.  \n"

# Strip leading and trailing whitespace
cleaned_text = text.strip()

# Remove extra spaces between words
cleaned_text = " ".join(cleaned_text.split())
print(cleaned_text)
```

]

---
# Removing numbers

.pull-left-wide[
**Why Remove Numbers?**
- Focus on the language rather than numbers
- Or maybe we are only interested in numbers
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
**Example Code:**

```{python}
import re

# Sample text
text = "The stock price increased by 20% in Q3 of 2021."

# Remove numbers
cleaned_text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)
print(cleaned_text)
```

]

---
# Handling special characters 

.pull-left-wide[
**Why Handle Special Characters?**
- Special characters (e.g., “$,” “@”) can introduce noise and mess with code.
- Removing or replacing them can simplify the text for analysis.
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
**Example Code:**

```{python}
# Sample text with special characters
text = "Check out our earnings on $AAPL and $GOOG!"

# Remove special characters (except letters and spaces)
cleaned_text = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z\s]', '', text)
print(cleaned_text)
```

]

---
# Unicode Normalization

.pull-left-wide[
**Why Normalize Unicode?**
- Text data may contain accented characters or symbols (especially in multilingual contexts).
- Unicode normalization ensures consistency.
- Sometimes information is lost, but consistency is gained
]

--

.pull-right-wide[
**Example Code:**

```{python}
import unidecode

# Sample text with Scandinavian accented characters
text = "Björk's café in Århus offers smørrebrød."

# Normalize text by removing accents
normalized_text = unidecode.unidecode(text)
print(normalized_text)
```

]

---
# Tying it all together

.pull-left-wide[
- String cleaning is often dependent on each specific project
- It is important that we keep consistency and replicability - especially if we want to match on strings
- Within a project we want to clean all strings in the same way.
- A good ideas is to define a function `clean_strigs()` which does this for your project

**Example code:**  
```{python}
import string
import unidecode

# Sample text
text = "   Earnings report:     Novo Nordisk shows increase.  \n Åse Aamund, CEO, reacts with optimism ..."

# Remove special characters (except letters and spaces)
def clean_strings(x):
  x = x.lower() # To lower
  x = x.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)) # Remove punct
  x = unidecode.unidecode(x)
  x = x.strip() # remove ws
  x = " ".join(x.split())
  
  return x
 
print(clean_strings(text))
```

# The `spaCy` library
.pull-left[
### What is `spaCy`?
- spaCy is an open-source, high-performance Natural Language Processing (NLP) library in Python.
- Designed for efficiency and ease of use in large-scale text processing tasks.
- Provides pre-trained models, powerful tokenization, and many NLP tools, including lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more.

- *many problems you encounter can be solved with spaCy alone*

]

.pull-right[
.small123[

```{python}
# Import and load spaCy's English model
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")  # Load a small English model

# Process a text
text = "The company's earnings have increased in Q3 2021."
doc = nlp(text)

# Display tokenized words
for token in doc:
    print(token.text)

```
]
]

---
# Lemmatization

.pull-left-narrow[
- Lemmatization reduces words to their base form (e.g., “earning” vs. “earnings”), creating a more consistent representation. 
- Useful if we want to count occurences of words without conjugation. 
- Especially useful for iregular words 
- First step in more grammar-heavy NLP

]

.pull-right-wide[
```{python}
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample text
text = "Earnings have increased, and the earner is satisfied."

# Lemmatize using spaCy
doc = nlp(text)
lemmatized_text = [token.lemma_ for token in doc]
print(lemmatized_text)
```

]

---
# Removing stopwords
.pull-left-narrow[
- Stopwords are uninformative words ['the', 'is', etc]
- (Still semantically useful - you din't want to remove them in more advanced NLP applications)
]

.pull-left-wide[
```{python}
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample text
text = "The company has shown an increase in earnings this year."

# Remove stopwords using spaCy
doc = nlp(text)
cleaned_text = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop]
print(cleaned_text)

```
]

---
# Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
.pull-left-narrow[
- POS tagging labels each token with its part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
- Understanding the grammatical role of words helps in tasks like sentiment analysis and text classification.
]

.pull-right-wide[
```{python}
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample text
text = "The stock price increased significantly."

# Perform POS tagging
doc = nlp(text)
pos_tags = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]
for x in pos_tags: print(x)
```
]

---
class: middle

# Lexical resources
.pull-left-narrow[
- Once we have cleaned the text, we can use it in analysis
- Further examples to come.
- One example here: Wordcount based sentiment analysis
- Mostly just a classroom exercise. But also has a few real world use cases. 
- Concepts generalize to more complex settings.

# AFINN package

- Afinn github: https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn
- Live Afinn: https://darenr.github.io/afinn/
> "That would have been splendid. It would have been absolutely amazing. The best there ever was. But it was not."

- 'best': 3, 'amazing': 4, 'splendid': 3
- (Note how it relates to the exercise - does modern transformer based sentiment agree?)

# A very simple sentiment analysis
.pull-left[
- What if we just count positive/negative words? 

### Advatages 
- You can explain this to anyone 
- Works supprisingly well 

### Disadvantages 
- Cannot understand context 
  + "Bull" is positive in finance
  + "Bull" is neutral/negative in everyday conversation
- Typos and spelling mistakes are unhandled
